# June 14th pt2: Middle and top part

Remade the middle sketch because i used the wrong origin and it was off by about 0.01mm D:

Started working on the top part mounts.

Needed standoffs and switched to the camera version with actual mount spots D:

* Standoffs: 2.8$ - [20 mm Aluminum standoffs](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/1005007945167923.html)

Total: 159,3$

Also made the near final version of the main body and made a WIP top part.

![3D + standoffs](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/5f502a8d05daaa797ed12a82fc53997cae4d3b45_image.png)

# June 14th pt3: 3D model + finished top

Finished the top by adding all of the standoff and velcro holes.

Found some placeholder models for the camera and motors + props.

# June 15th: Finishing touches

Random list of stuff I might/will need so i don't forget it:

* Heat‑shrink
* 4S Battery pack
* Battery strap
* Threadlocker
* Buzzer
* Zip-ties

Made some TPU softmounts and corners and added some space at the front for the camera. Also smoothed out some rought corners and edges.

**Total time spent: 2-3h**

# June 16th: Changed some stuff again

Found a cheaper and better VTX for the quad (along with a bunch of better parts for slightly more)

* VTX: 24$ - [HGLRC Zeus nano VTX](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/1005008043478143.html) (just better and cheaper)
* Camera: 27.3$ - [Caddx Ratel 2 V2](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/1005006254000307.html) (it's alot better but maybe slightly overkill)
* Motors: 30.6$ - [YSIDO 1505 2650KV](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/1005007544080274.html) (the other motors were for 6S, not 4S and i somehow missed that)
* ELRS Receiver: 12.14$ - [BETAFPV ELRS Nano](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/1005007437882037.html) (same receiver, saves money on shipping)
* VTX Antenna: 5.64$ - [Mini RHCP 5,8G Lollipop 4 antenna (Purple UFL Upgrade)](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/4001365632031.html) (wrong website)

Total: 170.48$

# June 17th: Checking fabrication prices

> TIFO carbon fiber CNC is **_REALLY EXPENSIVE_** and would be over 50% of all other parts combined.

Checked the prices on PCBWay for carbon fiber and polycarbonate and I'm now waiting for the order review to know the actual price.

![PCBWay order review](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/68630d41dd0fd13aa2924c8cac2d3051c2d52230_image.png)

This is how the rendered version of the drone frame is looking now:

(also spent way too long trying to export as a DXF from Fusion 360 but that requires a subcription so i had to do it using FreeCAD just to then realise that PCBWay uses step files, not DXF)

**Total time spent: 2h**

# June 18th: Sh!t, it's expensive

Just got the quotes and turns out getting it machined/3D printed won't be possible sadly :pensive-wobble: its wayyy outside of the 150$ budget :(

![ITS EXPENSIVE :whyyy:](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/91fc844e2cd5cd00e3af666291fe1463f8f248e6_image.png)

Will most likely have to try to get the frame/softmounts/corners from printing legion (as i don't own a 3D printer)

**TODO**: get the BOM under 150$ to fit in the 6 point middle tier (current BOM: 170.48$)

<sub>The current setup would need me to get the battery, battery straps and heatshrink myself, will see what i can do</sub>

**Total time spent: 1h**

# June 20th: The end (maybe)

> IT'S UNDER 150$!!!

Rechecked the price on everything and changed the camera back to the old one (much worse low ligth performance but the only way to fit the budget) and it's now under 150$ :yay: (excluding the frame :sob:)

* Props: 3.31$ - [2 Pairs HQProp 3525](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/1005008744409414.html)
* Camera: 13.98$ - [CADDXFPV Baby Ratel2 Analog Camera](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/1005006086694992.html)

Also double checked all the parts and they are currently have free shipping :p
